# Reservation - Mobile

## Welcome

Working in a fast-paced startup is a challenge - features are needed yesterday, resources are limited and requirements
are vague!

This scenario is based on a real world challenge faced at Henry - the solution became a core component of the businesses
success. The idea is to both give the developer a taste of that lifestyle, and allow Henry to evaluate their coding and
decision making capacity!

## Scenario

Henry has two kinds of users, **providers** and **clients**. Providers have a schedule where they are available to see
clients. Clients want to book time, in advance, on that schedule.

**Providers**

- Have an id.
- Have a schedule
    * On Friday the 13th of August, I want to work between 8am and 3pm.

**Clients**

- Have an id.
- Want to reserve a 15m time ‘slot’ from a providers schedule.
    * Reservations expire after 30 mins if not confirmed.
    * Reservations must be made at least 24 hours in advance.
- Want to be able to confirm a reservation.

## Task

Build the front end for a mobile web application that covers as many of the following as possible in the time allotted:

- Allows providers to submit times they’d like to work on the schedule.
- Allows clients to list available slots.
- Allows clients to reserve an available slot.
- Allows clients to confirm their reservation.

Use whichever toolset you think is reasonable!

## Assumptions

Assume the API is being worked on in parallel and for the time being you could create a mock API or just hardcoded data
from a file.

## Limitations

Try to limit development time to about 3hrs. Working within limited resources is a key component of this challenge. Feel
free to provide notes of the areas that could not be met within that timeframe, tradeoffs made to stay within that time
frame, or areas which would be handled differently before a production deployment.

## Submission

Please email a public link to your git repo codechallenge@henrymeds.com.

## Evaluation

This will be evaluated similar to a real-world submission, including:

- Does the code solve the business problem?
- What trade-offs were made, how wise are they?
- How clean/well structured is the code?
- What ‘extra’ factors are there, that show exceptional talent?
